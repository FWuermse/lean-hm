# HM math in Lean 4
This repository contains formalizations of mathematics taught at
Hochschule MÃ¼nchen. It tries to stick as closely as possible to
the definitions and proofs used there. Note that this is formalized
using Lean 4 so mathlib is in fact (on purpose) not available here
since this is meant as a learning project for Lean 4, not a how to
mathlib.

## Modules

    - [ ] logic
    - [ ] functions
    - [ ] limits
    - [ ] derivatives
    - [ ] integration

    - [ ] set theory and relations
    - [ ] injective, surjective, bijevtive etc.
    - [ ] number theory
    - [ ] permutations
    - [ ] landau
    - graph theory is excluded on purpose since even mathlib is only getting started with formalizing it
- [ ] cs theory
    - [ ] regular expressions
    - [ ] DFA/NFA
    - [ ] PDA
    - turing machines and P vs NP are excluded since even mathlib's formalization is rather different from what we learn (or non existent)
